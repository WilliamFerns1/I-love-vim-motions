A **tribute page** for a dear lover of mine, Vim motions.

## Why I love Vim Motions?
1. More productive
2. More money, as a side effect of being more productive
3. Smarter, because being more productive leads to faster learning and applying.
4. Flex: I look like a 'G' in front of average VSCoders.

## Technologies:
1. HTML
2. CSS

## Project Motive:
This is a certification project I get to do, for the course I am following. The project, is to make a tribute page. I started to think: "What would everyone else do?", and did the exact opposite. I spent like 10 to 20 minutes to just think of a unique idea, something nobody else would do.

## What I learnt from making this project:
